//Have someone enter a letter grade and use a switch statement to
//return a comment based on their grade.

/* Switch statement info:
The switch statement compares the grade variable to each of the 
case values.
        -Each case value represents a possible letter grade.
        -The code block associated with each case displays a message 
        based on the grade.
        -If a match is found, the corresponding code block is executed.

The break statement is used to exit the switch statement 
after a match is found. Â
